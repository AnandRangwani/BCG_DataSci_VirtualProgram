# BCG-DataAnalytics_Challenge
Virtual Experience Program by BCG.

# __________________________________________________________________
## Files provided by BCG:-
### Data Description --> Meta Data(Describing features)
### 1.) Task_Description_Task2.pptx --> Task Description for second Task
### 2.) ml_case_training_data.csv  -->  csv file containing all features of clients.
### 3.) ml_case_training_hist_data.csv  -->  csv file containing 'price' of 2015 (historical data).
### 4.) ml_case_training_output.csv  -->  contains the info which client churns and which doesn't churns.
### 5.) Discount Impact Task4, MUST READ --> Impact of Discount on churn rate, provided after submission of our solution, for review.

## Files made by me, solving the tasks:-
### 1.) BCG-Task1  -->  PDF of task-1, contains info about initial hypothesis given by PowerCo.
### 2.) Notebook-1_Task-2  -->  Code of initial data cleaning, interpreting missing values...etc
### 3.) Notebook-2_Task-2  -->  Data cleaning...
### 4.) Notebook-3_Task-2  -->  Feature engineering and feature selection.
### 5.) cleaned_data_for_ml_modelling.csv  -->  Completely cleaned data, contains no missing values, this data can be used ahead for Feature engineering.
### 6.) feature_selected_data.csv  -->  Clean Data on which Feature engineering is done. This data can be used for building ML model.
### 7.) Steps_FeatureEngineering.txt  -->  This text file explains the Data cleaning,Feature engineering steps done in Notebook-1,Notebook-2,Notebook-3.
### 8.) ML_model_making  -->  Code of building a efficient model using 'feature_selected_data.csv' .
### 9.) OverSampled_trainingData_ML_modelling.csv  -->  It contains over-sampled data that is used for training the model.
### 10.) OverSampled_testData_ML_modelling.csv  -->  It contains over-sampled data that is kept aside to check model's accuracy.
### 11.) final_model.pkl  -->  pickle file containing final trained model used for extracting interpretations.
### 12.) Interpretations_from_ML_model -->  'final_model.pkl' used to make interpretations that whether giving 20% discount to clients is a good step to reduce churn or not.
